Interactive repository for learning git

Welcome to your first Git repo! Congratulations on making it this far. Now we'll start adding files and telling git to start tracking them!

1. Create a new file and name it myFile_netid.txt
2. In your new file, type your favorite color and then save. 
3. In your command line type "$ git status". You should receive a message along the lines of there being an untracked file called "myFile_netid.txt".
4. Now type "$ git add myFile_netid.txt" and then "$ git status". You'll notice that it says myFile_netid.txt is being tracked.
5. Now type "$ git commit -m "Fancy commit message"" and finally once again "$ git status".
6. For the last time, type "$ git status". If all was done correctly, you will see that your local tree is up to date and ahead of origin by 1. 
7. Lastly, type "$ git push" and all the work you did will be uploaded and merged to the master branch on github's server. You can see it there by going to https://github.com/open-source-at-illinois/git-workshop

Good job! You're all done!
